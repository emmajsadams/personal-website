This is the repo for my personal website powered by typescript next.js. It is hosted at emma.cline.engineer using vercel

# TODO

- Deal with "warn - Tailwind is not purging unused styles because no template paths have been provided."
- Move all config into package.json like discord-mgmt-bot.
- Copy any build tools/config over from discord-mgmt-bot (like husky, and latest typescript config)
- Add PDF resume (yeeted my old one since out of date)
- Figure out some way to list email? Or recommend contact on LinkedIn instead to avoid spam?
- Setup Google Analytics using https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/measuring-performance instead of react-ga
- Review all gitlab projects and link them with nice descriptions
- Link pgp key for latest email and maybe setup keybasE?
- revisit style (check todos in css, think about more spacing in blog posts, code formatting not working for some reason)
- audit package.json (figure out what should be dev vs prod, remove unused packages)
- Expand on overview for clear documentation
- Setup eslint (see emmabot as example)
- setup tests
- Use next 10 features like i18n and image tag
- setup precommit hoook and github hook for running test
