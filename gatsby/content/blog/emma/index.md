After careful consideration over four months with medical professionals, I have come to realize that I suffer from gender dysphoria by presenting as a cis male. This is something I have known could always be a possibility, but as I have gotten older it has become untenable to maintain my cis male appearance.

Instead, I would prefer to be called Emma from now on and be referred to with she/her pronouns. Over the next two years, I will undergo significant changes as part of this transition.

The reality of language is that pronouns and names become a habit so I am completely understanding of mistakes. I trust that you all will make a good faith effort and that is all that matters to me!

I am an incredibly open person even for people I chat rarely with, so please do not hesitate to reach out to me with any questions. No question is off-limits so even if you just are a bit curious about the process or my history I am happy to explain.

Overall I am more optimistic and energetic than ever before so please do not feel the need to go easy on me.
