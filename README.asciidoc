This is the repo for my personal website powered by TypeScript next.js. It is hosted at emma.cline.engineer using vercel

# TODO

* look into https://asciidoc.org/ for blog posts instead of mdx. Likely using https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-asciidoc
* write resume in asciidoc. render that in react using react-asciidoc, and render pdf by converting to latex
* convert blog to asciidoc
* Expand on freelance role (mention discord bot, work with peter, other stuff)
* fully review past resume contents
* Deal with "warn - Tailwind is not purging unused styles because no template paths have been provided."
* Move all config into package.json like discord-mgmt-bot.
* Setup Google Analytics using https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/measuring-performance instead of react-ga
* Review all gitlab projects and link them with nice descriptions
* audit package.json (figure out what should be dev vs prod, remove unused packages)
* Expand on overview for clear documentation
* Setup eslint (see discord bot as example)
* configure typescript config correctly (see discord bot as example)

* create link shortening api to replace rbrandly
* generate sitemap.xml dnyamically
